## What is possible with github actions CI/CD

Automated Testing:
Code Quality Analysis: 
Builds: build binaries, container images, or deployment packages for different environments.

Deployment: Automate the deployment of your application to various environments (development, staging, production) 

Release Management: Automate the creation of release packages and versioning based on Git tags or release branches. 

Containerization: Build and push Docker images to container registries like Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, or AWS ECR. 

Monitoring and Alerts: Configure monitoring and alerting systems to notify you of build failures, performance issues, or infrastructure changes. You can integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog.

Workflow Orchestration: Define complex workflows with multiple steps, dependencies, and conditional logic. You can trigger workflows based on events like push, pull request

Cross-platform Support: GitHub Actions supports a wide range of operating systems, programming languages, and development tools. 

## Basic:

Note: Do it in a separate clean folder and repo as you are already inside a github repo.
