what if you want to run as many containers you need with a single command 
and run them as a seperate services by runing them in different group of networks and
communicate with each other?


docker compose docker-compose.yml up
docker compose docker-compose.yml down

docker compose docker-compose.yml build --no-cache

apt-get install curl
do a curl from one container to another,  curl http://flask-app1:8085/
